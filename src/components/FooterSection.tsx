              <AccordionContent>
                Cryptique bridges the gap between Web2 analytics and Web3 on-chain data, providing 
                you with a complete picture of your marketing performance. Without this unified view, 
                you're likely missing critical insights about your users' behavior and the true ROI 
                of your marketing efforts.

              <AccordionTrigger>Why should I use Cryptique over other alternatives?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                Unlike traditional analytics platforms that were built for Web2, Cryptique is 
                specifically designed for Web3 projects. We understand the unique challenges of 
                decentralized applications and provide specialized tools for tracking wallet-based 
                user journeys, token transactions, and community engagement.

              <AccordionTrigger>How does Cryptique work?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                Cryptique works by combining traditional web analytics with blockchain data. Our SDK 
                tracks user interactions on your website or dApp, while our blockchain integrations 
                monitor on-chain activities. We then correlate these data points to provide a 
                comprehensive view of your users' journey from initial awareness to on-chain conversion.
